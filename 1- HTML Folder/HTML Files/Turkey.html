		<p>The Port of Istanbul is also called the Port of Haydarpaşa or Port of Haidar Pasha (code TRHAY). The port authority is the General Directorate of Turkish State Railways (TCDD). TCDD owns a total of seven ports in Turkey and has connections to two more ports.

		The Port of Istanbul is one of the three major Turkey’s shipping ports, along with the Port of Ambarlı, and the Port of Zeytinburnu. Haydarpaşa was the largest port in Turkey until the early 2000s, as it was surpassed in TEUs by the Port of Ambarlı. Now, it is the third-largest port in Turkey. Haydarpaşa’s annual cargo volume exceeds 60 million tons.

		The Port of Haydarpaşa is located at the southern entrance to the Bosphorus. Two breakwaters protect vessels in the port, which total area is 343,420 square meters. The port handles ro-ro, containers, and general cargoes.

		Shipping is a major component of the Turkish economy. In 2019, 53,7% of imports and 60,3% of exports were by sea transport. The sea sector’s share in the Gross National Product (GNP) reached 2,4%. Moreover, ports under TCDD handle about 40% of the total cargo in the country.</p>
